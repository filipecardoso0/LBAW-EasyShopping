            <p class="text-neutral-50 font-normal text-center">The founders of Easy Shopping, are avid gamers themselves. Their story began in Portugal,
                in the mid 2000s. Children being children, they spent countless nights playing Counter-Strike, FIFA, CALL OF DUTY, Battlefield,
                F1, NBA, among other simulation and first-person shooter games. Actually, most of the early business ideas came to them while gaming. Fast forward through a couple of companies built and a lot of learning, our founders
                decided to circle back to what sparked entrepreneurship in them - gaming! Thatâ€™s how we came about.
                Easy Shopping was born in 2022.
